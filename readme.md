# Glob Simulation

A dynamic simulation of moving creatures within a container (`Glob`). This simulation demonstrates Newtonian physics-based collision handling and boundary constraints.

## Features

- Simulates creatures moving in a bounded container.
- Implements elastic collisions between creatures based on Newtonian physics.
- Handles edge collisions to prevent creatures from getting stuck.
- Supports adding new creatures dynamically during runtime.

## Demo

Include a GIF or a screenshot of your simulation here.
